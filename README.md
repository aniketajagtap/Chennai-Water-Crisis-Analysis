# Chennai-Water-Crisis-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Chennai reservoir levels to understand trends, seasonal patterns, and factors contributing to the 2019 water crisis.

📌 Project Overview  

This project analyzes the Chennai Water Crisis through historical reservoir data of the city’s four major water sources:  
Poondi  
Cholavaram  
Red Hills  
Chembarambakkam  

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, the notebook highlights seasonal patterns, long-term storage trends, and the drastic fall in water levels that led to the 2019 water crisis.

📊 Features of Analysis  
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
Handling dates, missing values, and column formatting.

2. Feature Engineering  
Creating Total water storage column.  
Extracting Year and Month for time-series grouping.

3. Exploratory Analysis  
Yearly and monthly trends in water levels.  
Pre-crisis vs. crisis year comparisons.

4. Visualizations  
Line charts showing seasonal variation.  
Bar charts for inter-reservoir comparisons.  

🔍 Observations  
1. Reservoir levels show seasonal peaks after the monsoon and steep declines during summers.  
2. 2017–2019 recorded the lowest levels, culminating in the 2019 crisis.  
3. Red Hills and Chembarambakkam reservoirs showed sharper declines than others.  
4. Long-term data indicates reduced resilience against rainfall variability, stressing the need for better water resource management.
